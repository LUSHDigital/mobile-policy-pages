		<h3>Website Cookies</h3>
			
		<p>Our app uses a few main cookies;</p>
			
		<p>We keep a session cookie which is a small file on our server allowing us to distinguish you from other users, so that we can keep a virtual &quot;basket&quot; of the products you add to your shopping cart.		</p>
		<p>We also use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, which sets a small cookie file on your device. This cookie stores no personal information about you and will keep a track of how you use our app. We use this anonymous information to help us further improve the shopping experience on our app.</p>
			
		<p>Some of the pages on the app use content embedded from another service, for example YouTube, you maybe sent cookies from these websites. We don&rsquo;t actually control these cookies and we would recommend that you visit these third parties for more information about their cookies:</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://stripe.com/gb">Stripe</a> (our payment provider).</li>
