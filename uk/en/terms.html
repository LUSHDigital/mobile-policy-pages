We are Lush Retail Limited (company registration number 03084750) of 29 High Street, Poole, Dorset BH15 1AB.
At Lush, we pride ourselves on delivering fresh, handmade cosmetics to your door and delivering excellent customer service every time.
We Believe in Excellent Service
We believe our Lush Customer Care team is one of the best around. They work hard to answer your calls and queries, they lovingly pick and pack your parcels and they send them out of the door with the care and attention they'd give to their nearest and dearest. If our service has rocked your world, or if you aren't 100% happy, call our team straight away on 01202 668545 or email <a href="mailto:wecare@lush.co.uk">wecare@lush.co.uk</a>. We aim to provide high quality service and all feedback helps us to improve each time.
We hope your experience on our app is a happy one, and we always aim to get your parcels posted out as quickly as humanly possible. 24 and 48 hour delivery is available, but unfortunately not available for all areas of the UK. To see a full list of postcodes covered by 24 and 48 hour delivery, or to see more information on our delivery options, please visit the delivery information page.
</p>

<h3>1. Ordering</h3>
<p>
Everyone is allowed one customer account, but you have to be 18 or over to do so. By placing an order on our app, you agree to give:</p>
<p>
Your real name<br />
Your e-mail address<br />
Your billing address<br />
A delivery address (this maybe the same as your billing address)<br />
A contact phone number (in case we need to speak to you about your order)<br /></p>
<p>
If the technology fails us or we make a genuine mistake, your order attempt may be unsuccessful. We will do everything we can to resolve this and aim to put that smile firmly back on your face. Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmation e-mail within 24 hours, and then one within 24 hours of your order being dispatched. Depending on which delivery option you've selected, you then have a rough idea of when to start running the bath or shower, or when your next stash of skin and hair care products will be with you.
If something is not in stock, we will let you know as soon as possible after the order has been placed. If we are expecting the item in soon, we may send it in a separate parcel after your main order has been despatched.
</p>
<p>
Once you are ready to check out, you will be directed to the shipping confirmation page where you may select the type of delivery, and the delivery and/or billing addresses. Our overseas delivery partner Lush Distribution Limited can offer you an EU delivery service as part of the checking out procedure, given we do not deliver to EU addresses.
After placing your order you will receive an automated acknowledgement.</p>

<h3>2. Delivery</h3>
<p>
We have a variety of delivery options for customers in the UK.<br>
<br />
Our Next Day (£6.95) and 48 hour (£4.95) options will be sent via courier. They will be delivered between 8am and 8pm and will require a signature. If you should miss our courier, they will leave a card with a number that can be called to arrange redelivery for a different day. If you choose 24hr or 48hr delivery, your items will not be delivered on Saturday or Sunday; you must order before 3pm on Wednesday for 48hr delivery or 3pm Thursday for 24hr if you need your Lush products before the weekend. 24 and 48 hour delivery is unfortunately not available for all areas of the UK. To see a full list of postcodes covered by 24 and 48 hour delivery, or to see more information on our delivery options, please click the delivery link on the right.</p>
<p>
Standard delivery (£3.95) - If you select this option parcels weighing less than 2kg will be sent with Royal Mail, so keep your eyes peeled for your local postie! For larger orders (over 2kg), we will use a courier, which will require a signature upon delivery.<br />
Collection (no charge) from one of our UK Lush stores.<br>
<br />
Delivery outside of the UK</p>
<p>
Our EU delivery partner, Lush Distribution Limited, can provide EU delivery for you, but we do not currently deliver outside the UK to EU addresses. Please see *Lush Distribution Limited's Terms and Conditions of delivery*. If you are ordering for delivery to an EU address you will be offered Lush Distribution Limited's EU delivery service once you reach the shipping confirmation page. Your overseas delivery charges will be confirmed to you, before your order is accepted.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you are ordering from overseas and don't want to incur the expense of overseas delivery you can also elect to have your products delivered to a UK address. This option can be selected as part of the Checkout procedure.
If you decline the costs of delivery offered by Lush Distribution Limited for EU deliveries and do not select the alternative of delivery to a UK address or collection from one of our UK Lush stores, Lush Retail Limited will not be able to process your order.</p>

<h3>Events beyond our control</h3>
<p>
We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under a Contract that is caused by events outside our reasonable control (Force Majeure Event).</p>

<p>Occasionally, parcels going overseas may be delayed at customs control when entering your country. This is beyond our control and we cannot be responsible for the late arrival of parcels detained in this way.</p>

<h3>Arrangements</h3>
<p>
After placing your order you will receive an automated acknowledgement by email. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm acceptance to you by confirming that your order has been dispatched (for orders for EU delivery, Lush Distribution Limited will confirm the details of delivery).</p>
<p>
For UK orders (i.e. orders to be delivered to a UK address) and non EU orders (i.e. orders to be delivered to a non EU address), once we accept your order, a contract to purchase and deliver products takes effect between you and Lush Retail Limited. For orders to be delivered to an EU address, once we accept your order, a contract to purchase the products takes effect between you and Lush Retail Limited. If you have selected the EU delivery option) a contract to deliver the products to you takes effect between you and Lush Distribution Limited (please refer to the standard Lush Distribution Limited Terms and Conditions).</p>
<p>
You pay the sum that you see at the end of the checkout process, together with the delivery. Lush Distribution Limited's overseas delivery charges are collected by us on behalf of Lush Distribution Limited during the checkout procedure and we undertake to make your payment to Lush Distribution Limited on your behalf following receipt of your payment to us.</p>
<p>
Upon receipt of your order for the products you will be charged for the products and the delivery costs (delivery costs for EU orders will be collected by Lush Retail on behalf of Lush Distribution Limited).</p>
<p>
Products being delivered to a UK or non EU address by us will be at your sole risk from the time of delivery to you. Products being delivered to EU (non UK) addresses by Lush Distribution Limited will be at your risk when such products are collected by Lush Distribution Limited (or Lush Distribution Limited's agent for you) from our premises.</p>

<h3>The Contract</h3>
<p>
When we confirm acceptance of your order by confirming the products have been despatched a legally binding contract will exist between us.  If we do not confirm acceptance we will refund your payment.</p>
<p>
Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a product. If we believe a customer acts against these Terms and Conditions, we reserve the right to cancel or suspend their order. </p>
<p>
This includes non-payment of ordered products and fraudulent use of our app and/or sales. We also reserve the right to bar certain e-mail addresses and telephone numbers from accessing our app to place orders. We will not accept an order from any customer who we have suspended.</p>
<p>
Ownership of the products will only pass to you when we have received full payment.<br />
A person who is not party to the contract shall not have any rights under or in connection with it.</p>

<h3>Fresh Orders</h3>
<p>
Our fresh face masks are like fresh groceries. They are made with only fresh ingredients and contain no preservatives; as a result, they need to be kept refrigerated. If you are ordering fresh from outside the UK, your fresh face mask may arrive in a less-than-fresh state. We accept no liability for this.</p>

<h3>3. Resale</h3>
<p>
By ordering from our app, you agree not to commercially resell any of our products. Commercially reselling our products is a breach of these terms and conditions and your agreement with us.</p>

<h3>5. Prices and VAT</h3>
<p>
Our prices, as stated on our app, are in pound sterling (£) and include VAT at 20%. You will be charged in pounds sterling even if you don't live in the UK. We reserve the right to alter prices at any time. Overseas orders may incur bank charges for international transactions. Prices and promotions held in our high street stores may not apply to this app, unless otherwise stated, and vice versa. Please note that offers are subject to availability and may end before originally advertised.</p>
<p>
Where you have requested delivery to a UK or EU address, the price paid for the product will usually include UK VAT, and UK VAT will be shown on your email sales notification.</p>
<p>
Where you are not a UK resident and you have requested delivery to a non-EU address, the products will normally be zero-rated and not subject to UK VAT.</p>
<p>
Free delivery offers, when available, only apply to UK Mainland.</p>

<h3>6. Customs</h3>
<p>
Products delivered to destinations outside the EU may be subject to taxes, fees, levies or other charges as a result of local legislation or customs formalities and we advise that you check the import charges applicable in any non-EU country before ordering Products to be delivered there.
The recipient of the order is responsible for all customs formalities for the import of the Products, and will be required to pay any additional charges for international delivery, including import duty, formal customs entry, taxes, levies and other charges that may be levied outside the EU. The recipient of the products, not the person placing the order, will receive a separate request for payment of these charges. If you are ordering Products to be delivered to someone else, please ensure they are made aware that they will be responsible for these additional charges.</p>
<p>
You (or the recipient of the products if different) will be the importer for all international deliveries of the products. Therefore, before placing an order, it's your responsibility to check that any products ordered comply with state and federal government import regulations, and that there are no local requirements or restrictions which may affect receipt of your order.</p>

<h3>7. Cancellations and Returns</h3>
<p>
We aim to dispatch orders within one working day, so if you want to cancel an order without incurring a cost for returning unwanted items to us, you will need to do it before your order is dispatched. If you do cancel an order, please call us on +44 (0) 1202 668545 and let us know during office hours, or via e-mail to <a href="mailto:wecare@lush.co.uk">wecare@lush.co.uk</a>. If you would like to change anything about an order we would recommend that, in the first instance, you give us a call on +44 (0) 1202 668545 or email us at <a href="mailto:wecare@lush.co.uk">wecare@lush.co.uk</a> to avoid having to pay for delivery again.</p>
<p>
You have a legal right to cancel a contract which starts from the date we confirm your order has been despatched, which is when the contract between us is formed.  If the products have already been delivered to you, you have a period of fourteen days in which you may cancel, starting from the day after the day you receive the products.   <br />Days mean calendar days, including weekends and public holidays.</p>
<p>
To cancel a contract, please contact us in writing to tell us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:wecare@lush.co.uk">wecare@lush.co.uk</a> or by sending a letter to: </p>

<h1>Lush Distribution Limited Terms and Conditions</h1>

Lush Distribution Limited's registered address is 18 - 20 Market Street, Poole, Dorset, UK, BH15 1NF; Company Number 7766909, ('LDL'); VAT number GB 131 5621 47.</p>
<p>
Lush.co.uk is a site operated by Lush Retail Limited whose registered address is 29 High Street, Poole, Dorset. BH15 1AB, Company Number 03084750, VAT Number GB 658 8551 83.</p>

<h3>How the overseas delivery contract is formed between you and LDL</h3>
<p>
Overseas delivery of products purchased from Lush Retail Limited via Lush.co.uk is offered by LDL as Lush Retail Limited, sell, but do not deliver products to customers located in EU Member States (excluding the UK). If you require delivery to an EU address please tick to accept LDL's EU delivery services as shown on the shipping confirmation page. By ticking to accept EU delivery from LDL you are contracting with LDL for delivery of your products on and subject to these terms and conditions of delivery.</p>
<p>
Once Lush Retail Limited accepts your order to purchase products (which will be confirmed to you in a separate acknowledgement) a contract to purchase the products from Lush Retail Limited takes effect between you and Lush Retail Limited and, if you are ordering from an EU Member State and have requested LDL's EU delivery service and accepted these terms and conditions, a contract to deliver the products takes effect between you and LDL.</p>
<p>
The contract to deliver products to you at an EU address only relates to those products confirmed in the confirmation email. LDL will not be obliged to deliver any other products which may have been part of your order until the despatch of your products has been confirmed.
You will be charged for the delivery service at the point that the order placed on the Lush app is accepted. Upon receipt of your order Lush Retail Limited will collect your payment for LDL's delivery service on behalf of LDL.</p>
<p>
Once LDL has picked up the products from Lush Retail Limited, LDL will assume responsibility for loss and risk whilst the products are in transit until the delivery is complete.</p>

<h3>Delivery costs</h3>
<p>
LDL will confirm the cost to deliver your products to your EU address at the checkout but prior to acceptance of your order. The delivery cost is determined by a combination of the size and weight of the order and the destination. If you decline the costs of delivery, Lush Retail Limited will have to cancel your order unless you select a UK address for delivery or select collection from a UK Lush Retail store of your choice.</p>
<p>
You can select these options on the checkout page but will have to provide a UK address for delivery or collect the products in person. LDL's delivery charges appear on the Lush Retail Limited delivery and order confirmation pages/emails as “delivery” after the subtotal for the value of the products purchased. Lush Retail Limited will collect Lush Retail Limited delivery charges from you on our behalf.</p>

<h3>Delivery Time</h3>
<p>
Delivery time to overseas destinations will vary depending on where the delivery destination. In the event that your order has not arrived within a reasonable period of time please contact LDL 1 Market Street, Poole, BH15 1NF or alternatively via email to <a href="mailto:customercare@lush.co.uk">customercare@lush.co.uk</a></p>

<h3>Delivery locations</h3>
<p>
Below is the list of EU countries LDL currently deliver to and the current minimum delivery charges. These amounts are provided as estimates only and additional charges may be incurred dependent upon the size weight and value of the products. The actual delivery charges will be calculated for you on the checkout pages prior to acceptance of your order. If your country does not appear on this list please contact LDL via email using this link (Insert suitable email link to an LDL controlled email account).</p>

<h3>Split delivery</h3>
<p>
LDL may split delivery of your order into several parts based on Lush Retail Limited's stock availability. You will not be charged extra for this facility.</p>

<h3>Data protection and privacy</h3><p>
Any personal information you provide to LDL directly or via Lush.co.uk and from which you can be identified is stored securely and confidentially and is processed fairly and lawfully in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>
LDL provides your details to its couriers that deliver your order and to Lush Retail Limited to administer your order.</p>
<p>
If you have any queries regarding LDL's use of your personal information or this privacy policy, you should contact Lush Distribution Limited, 1 Market Street, Poole, BH15 1NF.</p>
