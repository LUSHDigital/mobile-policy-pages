		<p>We take your privacy seriously; we&rsquo;re sure you do too, so please do have a read of the full policy.</p>
		
		<p>We realise it&rsquo;s quite long, so we&rsquo;ve tried to help you out by summarising it here, but we&rsquo;d still love you to take the time to read them in full. Basically:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>We collect information (including sensitive information) to make Lush&#39;s application useful to you.</li>
			<li>We&rsquo;ll keep you posted with Lush news if you opt in.</li>
			<li>Don&rsquo;t worry, your data is not publicly available and we won&rsquo;t pass it on to any third parties.</li>
			<li>To remember you, our system will store cookies. This helps us to improve the website, although you can opt out. We will not sell this information or give it away unless required by law.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Full Version</h1>

		<p>This statement discloses the privacy practices and policies for the Lush application. If you have any questions

		<p>Your personal data will be used for processing and invoicing your order and when dealing with your enquiries

			personal data about your health that you give to us.</p>

			and Lush Times! All you have to do sign-up via our app, website or customer care team and there you have it;
			you can then confirm that your e-mail address is correct and is the same address you have used to order with.</p>

		<p>We won&rsquo;t share your information with our third party providers and group companies. We treat your data as strictly confidential!</p>

		<h3>Website Cookies</h3>

		<p>Our app uses a few main cookies;</p>

		<p>We keep a session cookie which is a small file on our server allowing us to distinguish you from other users,
			so that we can keep a virtual "basket" of the products you add to your shopping cart.</p>

		<p>We also use Google Analytics, which sets a small cookie file on your device. This cookie stores no personal
			information about you and will keep a track of how you use our app. We use this anonymous information to help
			us further improve the shopping experience on our app.</p>

		<p>Some of the pages on the app use content embedded from another service, for example YouTube, you maybe sent
			cookies from these websites. We don&rsquo;t actually control these cookies and we would recommend that you visit
			these third parties for more information about their cookies:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://adyen.com">Adyen</a> (Our payment provider)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t sell the information collected by cookies, nor do we disclose the information to third parties,
			except where required by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies).
			We treat your information as sensitive and confidential.</p>

		<p>If you continue without changing your settings, we&rsquo;ll assume you are happy to accept all cookies on the Lush app.</p>

		<p>If cookies aren&rsquo;t enabled on your device, it will mean that your shopping experience on our website will be
			limited to browsing and researching. Unfortunately you will not be able to add
			products to your basket and buy them.</p>

		<p>(Now the lawyer type has left the room, aaargh! You know we will do the right thing and hope you will too.)</p>
