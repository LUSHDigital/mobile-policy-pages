	<p>We want to give you the best shopping experience, so please take a moment - honestly, it won&rsquo;t take long - to read about how all this works. It will take you through everything from ordering and paying online to delivery, using the app, and details about us. Thanks very much for reading.

	<h1>Our Terms</h1>

	<h3>Returns</h3>

	<p>Address for any returns:</p>

	<p>Lush Digital Fulfilment<br />Unit 1A, 74-76 Bioela St,<br />Villawood<br />NSW 2163</p>

	<p>We are Lush Australasia Retail Pty Limited (ABN 24 077 737 663) of Unit 1A, 74-76 Biloela St, Villawood, NSW 2163.</p>

	<p>At Lush, we pride ourselves on delivering fresh, handmade cosmetics to your door and delivering excellent customer service every time.</p>

	<p>We Believe in Excellent Service</p>

	<p>We believe our Lush Customer Care team is one of the best around. They work hard to answer your calls and queries,
	they lovingly pick and pack your parcels and they send them out of the door with the care and attention they&rsquo;d give
	to their nearest and dearest. If our service has rocked your world, or if you aren&rsquo;t 100% happy, call our team
	straight away on 1300 587 428 or email <a href="mailto:customercare@lush.com.au">customercare@lush.com.au</a>. We aim to provide high quality service and all
	feedback helps us to improve each time.</p>

	<p>We hope your experience on our app is a happy one, and we always aim to get your parcels posted out as quickly as
		humanly possible. To see more information on our delivery options, rates and times, please visit our
		delivery information page.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Ordering</li>
		<p>Everyone is allowed one customer account. By placing an order on our app, you agree to give:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your real name</li>
			<li>Your e-mail address</li>
			<li>Your billing address</li>
			<li>A delivery address (this maybe the same as your billing address)</li>
			<li>A contact phone number (in case we need to speak to you about your order)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If the technology fails us or we make a genuine mistake, your order attempt may be unsuccessful. We will do
			everything we can to resolve this and aim to put that smile firmly back on your face. Once you have placed
			an order, you will receive a confirmation e-mail within 24 hours, and then one within 24 hours of your order
			being dispatched. Depending on which delivery option you&rsquo;ve selected, you then have a rough idea of when to
			start running the bath or shower, or when your next stash of skin and hair care products will be with you.
			If something is not in stock, we will let you know as soon as possible after the order has been placed.
			If we are expecting the item in soon, we may send it in a separate parcel after your main order has been despatched.</p>

		<p>Placing an order is legally binding but this does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer.
			For more details you can also have a little look at &rsquo;Cancellations and Returns&rsquo; in these Terms and Conditions.</p>

		<p>If, in our reasonable opinion, a customer acts against these Terms and Conditions, we do reserve the right
			to cancel or suspend their involvement in a sale. This includes non-payment of ordered products or
			fraudulent use of our app and/or sales. We also reserve the right to bar certain e-mail addresses and
			telephone numbers from accessing our app to place orders. We will not accept any order from any customer
			who we have cancelled or suspended.</p>

		<li>Fresh Orders</li>
		<p>Our fresh face masks are like fresh groceries. They are made with only fresh ingredients and contain no
			preservatives; as a result, they need to be kept refrigerated. We strongly recommend that you select the
			Express Post delivery option for any orders containing fresh face masks. If you are ordering from a rural
			area or outside of the Express Post delivery area, your fresh face mask may arrive in a less-than-fresh
			state. We accept no liability for this.</p>

		<p>Any orders containing fresh face masks due to be shipped on Friday will be held and shipped the following
			Monday to minimise time spent in the postal system.</p>

		<li>Resale</li>
		<p>By ordering from our app, you agree not to commercially resell any of our products. Commercially reselling
			our products is a breach of these terms and conditions and your agreement with us.</p>

		<li>Payment and Security</li>
		<p>We do not hold your credit card data. You do not enter any credit card data into the Lush app. When you
			come to pay for your products you will be interfacing with the Adyen payment gateway.</p>

		<p>We accept Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, and JCB through Adyen. We also accept PayPal payments.
			Redemption of gift cards online is not available.</p>

		<p>You can also telephone your order to us; call 1300 587 428 to chat to our happy Lush Customer Care team.</p>

		<p>You can contact Lush Customer Care Monday-Friday 9am-5pm Sydney time. They will also be able to help you
			with any advice or help you may need with any Lush products. Alternatively, please e-mail your queries,
			problems or questions to <a href="mailto:customercare@lush.com.au">customercare@lush.com.au</a>.</p>

		<li>Prices and GST</li>
		<p>Our prices, as stated on our app, are in Australian dollars and include GST at 10%. You will be charged in
			Australian dollars even if you don&rsquo;t live in the Australia. We reserve the right to alter prices at any
			time. Overseas orders may incur bank charges for international transactions.</p>

		<li>Cancellations and Returns</li>
		<p>We aim to dispatch orders on the next working day, so if you want to cancel an order without incurring a
			cost for returning unwanted items to us, you will need to do it before your order is dispatched.
			If you do cancel an order, please call us on 1300 587 428 and let us know during office hours,
			or via e-mail to customercare@lush.com.au. Once your order has been confirmed, we are usually
			unable to make changes.</p>

		<p>You have a legal right to cancel a contract which starts from the date we confirm your order has been
			despatched, which is when the contract between us is formed. If the products have already been
			delivered to you, you have a period of fourteen days in which you may cancel, starting from the day
			after the day you receive the products. Days mean calendar days, including weekends and public holidays.</p>

		<p>If you wish to cancel your order with Lush Digital, please contact us on 1300 587 428 or
			<a href="mailto:customercare@lush.com.au">customercare@lush.com.au</a> within 12 hours of placing the order.
			You can still cancel the order once it has been dispatched but you will incur the postal cost of returning
			the parcel and the refund will not be processed until the parcel is received and reviewed by Lush Digital.</p>

		<p>Lush Digital is happy to offer customers a return or an exchange for items purchased online. Returns or
			exchanges are accepted on goods happy to offer customers a return or an exchange for items purchased
			online. Returns or exchanges are accepted on goods posted to the below address and will require
			proof of purchase.</p>

				postal label to use when returning the item to us. Once the item/s have been received and reviewed,
				you will either receive your new items (for exchange), or a refund for the cost of the purchase.

		<p>Once the item/s have been received and reviewed, you will either receive your new items (for exchange),
			or a refund for the cost of the purchase. Refunds will be issued directly to the credit card or Paypal
			account used for the purchase. Email notification will be sent once the return has been processed.
