		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		
		<p>We want to give you the best shopping experience, so please take a moment - honestly, it won’t take long - to read about how all this works. It will take you through everything from ordering and paying online to delivery, using the website, and details about us. Thanks very much for reading.</p>
		
		
		<h3>DETAILS</h3>
		<div class="textformat">
			<p>Welcome to <a href="https://www.lushsg.com/">sg.lush.com</a>&nbsp;– the wonderful world of Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics. This website is operated by Lush Singapore, under the care of Sash Natural Pte Ltd (UEN no. 201116501G) at 5 Tank Road, #04-01 Singapore 238061. Just so you know, when you use and/or order products from this website, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions, and, from this point onwards, any reference to "we", "us", "our" or "ourselves" refers to Lush Singapore. Which makes sense really, right?</p>
			<p>We hope you have a lovely experience on our website. We spend many long hours by candlelight, wearing our fancy thinking caps, to ensure that this is the best possible website we can give our customers. Sometimes, however, things can break or go wonky, but we jump on the problems and try to sort them straight away. This might mean that your experience is a bit maddening, which makes us feel blue. So, if you do spot any errors, please hop on your computer as soon as you can and e-mail us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="48273a2c2d3a3b08243d3b203b2f662b2725">[email&#160;protected]</a>, so that we can work on getting it fixed as soon as we can.</p>
			<p>Because all of our products are fresh, handmade and contain lots of fresh ingredients, each batch of our products can come out slightly differently. This can then mean the product will differ from the one that Mr. Postman delivers to your front door, despite our best efforts to replicate the colours on the website. Colours also show up differently on different monitors.</p>
			<p>So, are you sitting comfortably? Good, then we shall begin!</p>
			<h3>ONLINE ORDERING&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>Before you can place an order, you will need to register and then log in. Everyone is allowed one customer account. You are more than welcome to send lots of Lush to your friends, but they may live in a different house. All you need to do is complete a separate order for each different delivery address. Easy!</p>
			<p>Very occasionally, if the technology fails us or we make a genuine mistake, your order attempt may be unsuccessful. While we can't be held liable for this, we will do everything we can to resolve this for you and put that smile back on your face again.</p>
			<p>Once your order has been accepted, you just pay the sum that you see at the end of the checkout process, together with the delivery fee. We will only accept credit or debit cards in the name of the customer placing the order. Once you have placed an order, you will receive an e-mail within 24 hours, and then one within 48 hours of your order being dispatched, so you will know when to get the bath running!</p>
			<p>Placing an order is legally binding but this does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer. For more details you can also have a little look at 'Cancellations and Returns' in these Terms and Conditions.</p>
			<p>Please note that actual weight of Lush products may vary due to external and environmental factors.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If, in our reasonable opinion, a customer acts against these Terms and Conditions, we do reserve the right to cancel or suspend their involvement in a sale. This includes non-payment of ordered products or fraudulent use of our website and/or sales. We also reserve the right to bar certain e-mail addresses and telephone numbers from accessing our website to place orders. We will not accept any order from any customer who we have cancelled or suspended.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>PRICES &amp; GOODS AND SERVICES TAX</h3>
			<p>Please note that the prices as stated on our website are in Singapore dollars. All prices are inclusive of Singapore Goods and Services Tax (GST) otherwise known as a Value Added Tax (VAT). Please keep in mind that you are responsible for import fees and taxes specific to your country.</p>
