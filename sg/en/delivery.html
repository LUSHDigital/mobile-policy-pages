		<h3>Shipping Information</h3>
			<div class="textformat">
			
					<p class="margin-bottom-space10 size-8">Placing an order? We can’t wait to unite you with your items! Please bear in mind, however, that delivery estimates are calculated from the time of despatch, rather than from the moment you place your order. As each product is carefully picked and packed by hand, these estimates can vary, particularly during busy times of the year. So if your order isn’t despatched straight away, don’t panic! We’re on it.</p>
					<p class="margin-bottom-space10 size-8">The majority of orders placed are processed and dispatched the next working day. In the event that we receive incomplete customer shipping information (e.g. no contact phone number), order processing may take more time and shipments may be delayed.</p>
					<p class="margin-bottom-space10 size-8">Orders are shipped on business days only. Business days are Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays.</p>
					<p class="margin-bottom-space10 size-8">All orders require a signature upon receipt. We are unable to redirect orders once items have been dispatched, so please ensure that someone is available at specified shipping address to accept your order. </p> </div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Shipping Fees</strong></p>
					<p>Shipping charges are fixed for orders at flat rate: -</p>
					<p>Singapore, within 1 to 2 working days - $5.00</p>
					<p>Malaysia, within 3 to 5 working days subjected to customs clearance&nbsp;-&nbsp;$18.00</p>
					<p>Duties &amp; taxes shall be beared by the customer.</p>

		<p class="margin-bottom-space10 size-8">Everyone is allowed one customer account. You are more than welcome to send lots of Lush products as gifts to your friends, but they may live in a different address. All you need to do is complete a separate order for each different delivery address. Easy! All customers must include their telephone numbers when they check out, as it is required for our couriers to make the deliveries. </p> </div>
