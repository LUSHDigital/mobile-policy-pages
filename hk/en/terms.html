If our service has rocked your world, or if you aren't 100% happy, call our team straight away on (852) 2423-3833 or email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3754424443585a524554564552775b42445f1a5f5c1954585a"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0c6f797f786361697e6f6d7e694c60797f64216467226f6361">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a>.

                                    <p>We hope your experience on our website is a happy one, and we always aim to get your parcels posted out as quickly as humanly possible.&nbsp;Next working day delivery is available for delivery addresses within Hong Kong , but unfortunately it will take a bit longer time to deliver our orders to Macau, China and other countries&nbsp;depending on the destination and customs clearance time.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p><strong>1. Ordering</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Everyone is allowed one customer account, but you have to be 18 or over to do so. By placing an order on our website, you agree to give:</p>
                                    <p>Your real name<br/>
                                    Your e-mail address<br/>
                                    Your billing address<br/>
                                    A delivery address (this maybe the same as your billing address)<br/>
                                    A contact phone number (in case we need to speak to you about your order and for courier purpose)</p>
                                    <p>If the technology fails us or we make a genuine mistake, your order attempt may be unsuccessful. We will do everything we can to resolve this and aim to put that smile firmly back on your face. Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmation e-mail within 24 hours, and then your order will be dispatched on the next working day after our confirmation e-mail is sent out. Depending on which delivery option you've selected, you then have a rough idea of when to start running the bath or shower, or when your next stash of skin and hair care products will be with you</p>
                                    <p>If something is not in stock, we will let you know as soon as possible after the order has been placed.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Once you are ready to check out, you will be directed to the shipping confirmation page where you may select the type of delivery, and the delivery and/or billing addresses.</p>
                                    <p>You pay the sum that you see at the end of the checkout process, together with the delivery cost. After placing your order you will receive an automated acknowledgement by email. This is not our confirmation email.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

They are made with only fresh ingredients and contain no preservatives; as a result, they need to be kept refrigerated. If you are ordering our fresh face masks from outside Hong Kong, &nbsp;they may arrive in a less-than-fresh state, and we do not recommend &nbsp;them to be &nbsp;sent cross border due to their short product life and extra time in delivery. We accept no liability for this.</p>

                                    <p><strong>6. Customs</strong></p>
                                    <p>Products delivered to Hong Kong and Macau shall not be subject to any taxes.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Products delivered to destinations outside Hong Kong or Macau may be subject to taxes, fees, levies or other charges as a result of local legislation or customs formalities. We advise that you check the import charges applicable in your country before ordering products to be delivered there.</p>
                                    <p>You (or the recipient of the order if different) will be responsible for all customs formalities for the import of the products, and may be required to pay any additional charges for international delivery, including but not limited to import duty, formal customs entry, taxes, levies and other charges that may be levied. The recipient of the products, not the person placing the order, will receive a separate request for payment of these charges. If you are ordering products to be delivered to someone else, please ensure they are made aware that they will be responsible for these additional charges.</p>
                                    <p>You (or the recipient of the products if different) will be the importer for all international deliveries of the products. Therefore, before placing an order, it's your responsibility to check that any products ordered comply with the applicable government import regulations, and that there are no local requirements or restrictions which may affect receipt of your order.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>We exclude our liability for any non-delivery or late delivery of the products arisen from problems with customs clearance.&nbsp;</p>
